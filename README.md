# Role-based-recommendersystem


Having previously worked on a Movie Recommendation System, I was already familiar with similarity-based recommendation techniques. This experience inspired me to develop a Job Role Recommendation System using Python, NLP, and Machine Learning to help users explore similar job roles based on required skills.


APPROACH:

Data Processing: Created a structured dataset of job roles and their required skills as it was given in pdf.

Feature Extraction: Utilized CountVectorizer to convert skill descriptions into numerical vectors.

Similarity Measurement: Applied Cosine Similarity to determine how closely job roles relate based on skill sets.

Recommendation System: Identified the top three most relevant job roles for a given input.



IMPORTANT CONCEPTS OF THE TASK:

Count Vectorizer converts each job skills into a vector, Vector is a set of scalars. It transforms a collection of text documents into a bag-of-words representation, where each unique word is assigned a frequency-based vector.The max_features parameter limits the number of unique words considered when transforming text data. It keeps only the top N most frequent words, reducing dimensionality and improving efficiency.in this we have max_features as 10 so it will take 10 most frequent words. you can consider max_features as a HyperParameter and we have to select the best value for the dataset.

Cosine similarity is useful because it measures directional similarity rather than magnitude, making it ideal for text-based data.

The first line finds the index of the given job role in the DataFrame. The second line retrieves its similarity scores from the cosine similarity matrix, showing how closely it relates to other roles. top_roles = sorted(list(enumerate(distances)), reverse=True, key=lambda x: x[1])[1:4] first enumerates these similarity scores, creating a list of index-score pairs, then sorts them in descending order based on similarity values, and selects the top three most similar roles while excluding the input role itself.
